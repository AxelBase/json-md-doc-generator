    <p style="color: var(--text-dark);">Last updated: {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}</p>
    
    <p>We respect your privacy and designed json-md-doc-generator to operate without collecting, storing, or transmitting any personal or sensitive data.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: var(--accent); margin-top: 2rem;">Local Processing Only</h3>
    <p>All features of this tool run entirely in your web browser. When you upload a JSON file or paste content, the data is processed in memory only. It is never sent to a remote server, saved on disk by the app, or logged for analytics. Once you refresh or close the page, all content is permanently discarded.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: var(--accent); margin-top: 2rem;">No Tracking</h3>
    <p>We do not use cookies, localStorage, or tracking technologies to monitor your usage. The app does not collect usage statistics, device identifiers, or personal information.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: var(--accent); margin-top: 2rem;">Downloaded Files</h3>
    <p>Generated Markdown files are created on your device using browser APIs. They are stored only where you choose to save them. The app has no access to your filesystem or saved documents.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: var(--accent); margin-top: 2rem;">Third-Party Libraries</h3>
    <p>The app uses open-source libraries for UI and functionality (such as Svelte, Bootstrap). These libraries run locally and do not transmit your data.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: var(--accent); margin-top: 2rem;">External Links</h3>
    <p>If the site links to third-party resources (e.g., documentation), those sites may have their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for their practices.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">By using this tool, you consent to the privacy practices described above. If you do not agree, simply refrain from using the tool.</p>
